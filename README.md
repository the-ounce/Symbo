# Symbo

Enhanced tool for symbolication of macOS and iOS crash logs.

## Overview

Symbo is designed to help developers and engineers analyze crash reports by converting memory addresses into readable function names and line numbers.
It's an improved and redesigned version of MacSymbolicator, originally created by [Mahdi Bchatnia (inket)](https://github.com/inket). 

## Features

Symbo's useful features:

- Drag-and-drop interface for crash logs and dSYM files
- Text input option for pasting a crash log directly
- Automatic search of relevant dSYM files (exactly, no manual clicks needed)
- Support for crash logs in TXT format
- Crash log viewer with highlighting of symbolicated addresses
- Easy export of symbolicated results
